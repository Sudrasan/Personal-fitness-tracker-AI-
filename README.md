# Personal-fitness-tracker-AI-
Our website offers an AI-powered fitness tracker that predicts calories burned during exercise based on user details like age, gender, BMI, heart rate, body temperature, and exercise duration. Using machine learning models, it helps users monitor fitness levels, make informed health choices, and track progress over time.

🔍 Overview
This project is an AI-powered fitness tracking system designed to predict calories burned based on user input. It utilizes machine learning models like Random Forest Regressor to estimate calories burned during physical activities such as walking, running, and other exercises. The system is accessible through a web-based application, offering an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for users to track their fitness progress.

🚀 Features
✅ AI-based calorie burn prediction using user inputs like age, BMI, heart rate, body temperature, and exercise duration.
✅ Utilizes Random Forest Regressor and other ML techniques for accurate predictions.
✅ Web-based application for seamless accessibility and interaction.
✅ Real-time predictions with an easy-to-use interface.
✅ Personalized feedback and insights comparing user data with others.
